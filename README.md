## Decentralized Infrastructure
Our network is built on a fully decentralized infrastructure designed to support a distributed ecosystem, preventing central points of control and maximizing both security and autonomy for all participants.

## Proven Proof of Work Mechanism
Harnessing Ethash, an established and secure consensus algorithm, our network ensures true decentralization, stability, and battle-tested resilience, offering reliability in every transaction and validation.

## Dynamic Tokenomics
To promote sustained engagement and reward ecosystem supporters, the block reward begins at 100 tokens and follows a deflationary model, gradually decreasing over time. This incentivized structure is crafted to encourage long-term participation and stability.

## EVM Compatibility for DApp Ecosystem Growth
With full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), developers can seamlessly deploy and scale decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. This compatibility opens doors for a diverse, thriving ecosystem of DApps to evolve on our platform.

## Fair Distribution with No Instamine
A sufficiently high initial block difficulty level prevents instamining, ensuring fair distribution from the very first block and protecting the integrity of the token distribution.

## Low Transaction Fees
Our low-fee model makes transaction costs minimal, enabling high accessibility and cost-efficient interactions across the network, whether for simple transfers or complex contract executions.

## Efficient Reward System without Uncle Rewards
Our streamlined block reward system focuses solely on main blocks, eliminating uncle rewards. This design enhances clarity, simplifies miner incentives, and supports a more transparent network environment.

# Roadmap

## Phase 1
Mainnet Launch, Exchange Listings, Targeted Marketing, and Community Growth Initiatives.

## Phase 2
Launch of Wallet API & Smart Contract Visualizer, enabling developers and users alike to interact seamlessly with the network.

## Phase 3
Future Network Expansions, Community-Driven Upgrades, and Ongoing DApp Ecosystem Development.

# Strategic Allocation & Development
We have earmarked approximately 40 million ETY for development and future expansion efforts. Unlike many networks, our project operates with zero dev fees on mined blocks, ensuring that miner rewards stay in the ecosystem. Our primary focus is the development of a user-friendly API layer, enabling smart contract creation through an intuitive, drag-and-drop interface with straightforward input fields, greatly simplifying the process for both novice and experienced developers alike.

# Block Reward Structure

Etherify adopts a decreasing block reward system, incentivizing sustained engagement over time. Below is the reward schedule:

| Block Range         | Reward per Block
| ------------------- | ---------------------- 
| 0 - 100,000         | 100 ETY                   
| 100,001 - 200,000   | 90 ETY                    
| 200,001 - 300,000   | 80 ETY                    
| 300,001 - 400,000   | 70 ETY                    
| 400,001 - 500,000   | 60 ETY                    
| 500,001 - 600,000   | 50 ETY                    
| 600,001 - 700,000   | 40 ETY                    
| 700,001 - 800,000   | 30 ETY                    
| 800,001 - 900,000   | 20 ETY                    
| 900,001 - onwards   | 10 ETY
